# Deploying a Laravel Website: 

## sudo command: 
sudo stands for "super user do". It's a command that is primarily used for Unix-based operating systems such as Linus and macOS.
sudo allows authorized users to execute commands as another user, typically the root user, which has full system privileges. 
It is often used in shell scripts and other automated process to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges, such as installing software, modifying system settings, or accessing protected files. 
The syntax for using the sudo command is typically sudo [command].

Here are some common use cases of sudo:

* Installing and updating software
* Modifying system settings
* Accessing protected files
* Performing system maintenance tasks

## apt-get command: 
The apt-get command is a package management tool for Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, which allows users to install, upgrade, and remove software packages on their system.

Here are some of the common use cases of apt-get:

* Installing new packages: apt-get install <package-name> can be used to download and install a new software package from the configured repositories.
* Upgrading packages: apt-get upgrade can be used to download and install the latest version of all packages on the system.
* Removing packages: apt-get remove <package-name> can be used to remove a package from the system.
* Updating package information: apt-get update can be used to refresh the package database on the system, so that the latest information about available packages can be retrieved.
* Resolving package dependencies: apt-get automatically resolves dependencies when installing or upgrading packages, ensuring that all required packages are installed on the system.
  
The apt-get command is a powerful tool for managing software packages on a Linux system, and is often used by system administrators to ensure that their servers have the latest security updates and software packages installed.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
